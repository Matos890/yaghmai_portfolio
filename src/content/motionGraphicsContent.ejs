        I can create explainer videos using motion graphics to make your project
        or business even more accessible and easy to understand. If you're
        looking to tell a story, this technique will undoubtedly make it more
        engaging and captivating. To produce these videos, I primarily use Adobe
        software, including Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects. Feel free
        to reach out for more information!

        Mobi Doc is an in-progress ambitious web documentary centered around the
        almost untapped history of identity documents for the Institut
        Convergence Migration. The project will comprise six video essays made
        with an elaborate technique of Motion Graphic integrated with interviews
        and other documents. Here you can find a trailer with the design
        conceptualization of the first episode. The ambitious idea to provide a
        context to the history of the passports started from simple questions:
        when was the first passport released? and what kind of identity system
        did governments use before passports and Identity cards?
