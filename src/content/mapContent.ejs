        Maps were my gateway into the world of design. Their elegance and rich
        layers of meaning allow complex concepts to be understood at a glance,
        seamlessly merging geography with data or detailed narratives. To craft
        my maps, I rely on geographic software such as <strong>QGIS</strong>,
        which, when combined with <strong>SQL</strong> and
        <strong>Python</strong>, enables precise data selection and
        representation. I then refine the visuals with
        <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, adding a layer of aesthetic
        sophistication to the final product. A key area of expertise is
        georeferencing historical maps and reimagining them through a modern
        lens. My work has been published in both print and digital formats.
